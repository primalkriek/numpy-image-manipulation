# numpy-image-manipulation
___________________________
Welcome to the mini project that is part of a training course.


to start
- make sure you have anaconda installed on your local machine, if you need help on this, check out the docs

```
https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html
```

- create a new folder on your local machine and navigate into it

- while in the new folder, clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/primalkriek/numpy-image-manipulation.git
```

- install a new conda environment using the following command: 

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

- put an image in the /data/images folder

- once this is done go to a new command line or terminal window and startup jupyter notebooks in the root 
folder if you are not in it anymore

```
jupyter notebook .
```

- a browser window should open with your directory structure:

![jupyter notebook directory view](<Screenshot 2023-12-30 at 21.46.01.png>)

if not, copy one of the lines from the cmd or terminal window, yours should look something like this:

```
http://localhost:8889/?token=ba2a474c4ea9644f29e053daa493124560a438d4b3ae521c
or http://127.0.0.1:8889/?token=ba2a474c4ea9644f29e053daa493124560a438d4b3ae521c

```

- navigate into the notebooks folder
- start the notebook
- do not start with run all, but instead run the code cell with to load the required libraries
- in the code cell as presented in below screenshot input the path to your image
![input ](image.png)
- now feel free to run the next cells how you feel like.  Every code cell has options to explore that manipulate the loaded image
